### Overview
[Microsoft Entra Domain Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-entra-ds/) provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, Kerberos/NTLM authentication that is fully compatible with Windows Server Active Directory, without having to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers as required by self-ma
naged domain controllers.  Domain Services integrates with your existing Microsoft Entra tenant. This integration lets users sign in using their corporate credentials, and you can use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources.

A Domain Services managed domain is a DNS namespace and matching directory. In a managed domain, the domain controllers (DCs) that contain all the resources like users and groups, credentials, and policies are part of the managed service. For redundancy, two DCs are created as part of a managed domain. You can't sign in to these DCs to perform management tasks. Instead, you create a management VM that's joined to the managed domain, then install your regular AD DS management tools. You can use the Active Directory Administrative Center or Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins like DNS or Group Policy objects, for example.
