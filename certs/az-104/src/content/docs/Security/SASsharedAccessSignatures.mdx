title: Shared Access Signatures in Azure
---
### Overview
A [shared access signature (SAS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) is a token that is appended to the URI for an Azure Storage resource. The token that contains a special set of query parameters that indicate how the resources may be accessed by the client. One of the query parameters, the signature, is constructed from the SAS parameters and signed with the key that was used to create the SAS. This signature is used by Azure Storage to authorize access to the storage resource.

### Types of shared access signatures
Azure Storage supports three types of shared access signatures:
- [User delegation SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#user-delegation-sas)
- [Service SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#service-sas)
- [Account SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview#account-sas)


#### [User Delegation SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas)
You can secure a shared access signature (SAS) token for access to a container, directory, or blob by using either Microsoft Entra credentials or an account key. A SAS secured with Microsoft Entra credentials is called a user delegation SAS. As a security best practice, we recommend that you use Microsoft Entra credentials when possible, rather than the account key, which can be more easily compromised. When your application design requires shared access signatures, use Microsoft Entra credentials to create a user delegation SAS to help ensure better security.

Every SAS is signed with a key. To create a user delegation SAS, you must first request a user delegation key, which you then use to sign the SAS. The user delegation key is analogous to the account key used to sign a service SAS or an account SAS, except that it relies on your Microsoft Entra credentials. To request the user delegation key, call the Get User Delegation Key operation. You can then use the user delegation key to create the SAS.

A user delegation SAS is supported for Blob Storage and Data Lake Storage, and can be used for calls to blob endpoints and dfs endpoints. It's not currently supported for Queue Storage, Table Storage, or Azure Files. Stored access policies aren't supported for a user delegation SAS.


##### Question
You need to generate the shared access signature (SAS) token required to authorize a request to a resource.  Which two parameters are required for the SAS token? Each correct answer presents part of the solution?

##### Answer
`SignedServices (ss)` is required to refer blobs, queues, tables, and files. `SignedResourceTypes (srt)` is required to refer services, containers, or bjects. `SignedStart (st)` is an optional parameter that refers to the time when the SAS becomes valid. If unmentioned, the start time is assumed to be the time when the storage service receives the request. `SignedIP (sip)` is an optional parameter that refers to the range of IP addresses from which to accept requests.
