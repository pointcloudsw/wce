Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.       
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

### Azure App Service
#### Scale rules
Enable divide by instance count - If enabled the metric value is divided by the total number of instances. Ex. If message count is 300 and there are 5 instances, then the calculated metric value is 60 messages per instance. Note: This property may not be applicable for all metrics.

Metric threshold to trigger action - This is the value of metric that Autoscale service checks against so as to evaluate whether to initiate a scale action or not. If control 'Enable metric divide by instance count' is checked, then the value specified here is compared against the actual value of the metric divided by instance count.

Duration - This is amount of time that Autoscale engine will look back for metrics. For example, 10 minutes means that every time autoscale runs, it will query metrics for the past 10 minutes. This allows your metrics to stabilize and avoids reacting to transient spikes. The Storage queue Approximate Message Count and Service Bus Message Count metrics are special in that these metrics are point in time only and have no history. For these metrics, the duration field will be ignored by the Autoscale engine.

Time grain - The metric sampling duration. For example, TimeGrain = "PT1M" means that the metrics will be aggregated every 1 minute using the aggregation method specified in 'Time grain statistic' control. The grain is automatically chosen from the smallest supported grain of the selected metric. This is so the Autoscale engine can accurately respond to the metric changes.

Time grain statistic - This is the aggregation method within the timeGrain period. For example, statistic = "Average" and timeGrain = "PT1M" means that the metrics will be aggregated every 1 minute by taking the average.

Time aggregation - This is the aggregation method used to aggregate the sampled metrics. For example, TimeAggregation = "Average" will aggregate the sampled metrics by taking the average.

Cool down - The amount of time to wait after a scale operation before scaling again. For example, if cooldown is 10 minutes and a scale operation just occurred, Autoscale will not attempt to scale again until after 10 minutes. This is to allow the metrics to stabilize first.

### Azure Bastion
Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you provision to securely connect to virtual machines via private IP address. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines:
- **Directly** over TLS from the Azure portal
- **Natively** via the native SSH client already installed on your local computer
- **Natively** via the native RDP client already installed on your local computer
When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.
