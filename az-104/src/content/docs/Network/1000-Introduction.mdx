### Networking Foundation
#### Virtual network
[Azure Virtual Network (VNet)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. You can use VNets to:
- **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy virtual machines, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy into a virtual network, see [Virtual network service integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services).
- **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering or Azure Virtual Network Manager. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. For more information, see [Virtual network peering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) and [Azure Virtual Network Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network-manager/overview).
- **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a virtual network can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address) or public [Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to manage your outbound connections.
- **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) or [ExpressRoute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).
- **Encrypt traffic between resources**: You can use [Virtual network encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview) to encrypt traffic between resources in a virtual network.

#### Network security groups
You can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a network security group. For more information, see [Network security groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

#### Service endpoints
[Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your virtual network to the Azure services, over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your virtual network to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

<figure><Image src={VnetSvcEpOverview} alt="VNet Service Endpoints" width="750" /><figcaption>Virtual network service endpoint example</figcaption></figure>

#### Azure Private Link
[Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Traffic between your virtual network and the service travels through the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers.

<figure><Image src={NtwkAzPrvLnkEx} alt="Azure Private Link / Private Endpoint" width="750" /><figcaption>Azure Private Link (aka Private Endpoint) Example</figcaption></figure>

#### Azure DNS
[Azure DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/) provides DNS hosting and resolution using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Azure DNS consists of three services:
- [Azure Public DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview) is a hosting service for DNS domains. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
- [Azure Private DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview) is a DNS service for your virtual networks. Azure Private DNS manages and resolves domain names in the virtual network without the need to configure a custom DNS solution.
- [Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview) is a service that enables you to query Azure DNS private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa without deploying VM based DNS servers.
Using Azure DNS, you can host and resolve public domains, manage DNS resolution in your virtual networks, and enable name resolution between Azure and your on-premises resources.

#### Azure Bastion
[Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) is a service that you can deploy in a virtual network to allow you to connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. You can also connect using the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you deploy inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software. There are various different SKU/tiers available for Azure Bastion. The tier you select affects the features that are available. For more information, see [About Bastion configuration settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/configuration-settings).

<figure><Image src={NtwkAzBastion} alt="Azure Bastion" width="750" /><figcaption>Azure Bastion Example</figcaption></figure>

#### Azure Route Server
[Azure Route Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/overview) simplifies dynamic routing between your network virtual appliance (NVA) and your virtual network. It allows you to exchange routing information directly through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol between any NVA that supports the BGP routing protocol and the Azure Software Defined Network (SDN) in the Azure Virtual Network (VNet) without the need to manually configure or maintain route tables.
<figure><Image src={NtwkAzRteSrvr} alt="Azure Route Server" width="750" /><figcaption>Azure Route Server Example</figcaption></figure>

#### NAT Gateway
[Azure Virtual Network NAT(network address translation) Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview) simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. Outbound connectivity is possible without load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. For more information, see What is Azure NAT gateway?
<figure><Image src={NtwkAzNatGw} alt="Azure vNAT Gateway" width="750" /><figcaption>Azure vNAT Gateway Example</figcaption></figure>

#### Traffic Manager
[Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods) is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Traffic Manager provides a range of traffic-routing methods to distribute traffic such as priority, weighted, performance, geographic, multi-value, or subnet.

The following diagram shows endpoint priority-based routing with Traffic Manager:
