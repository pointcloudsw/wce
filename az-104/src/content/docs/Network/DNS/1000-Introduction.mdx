The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating (resolving) a service name to an IP address. Azure DNS provides DNS hosting, resolution, and load balancing for your applications using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

Azure DNS supports both internet-facing DNS domains and private DNS zones, and provides the following services:

[Azure Public DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/public-dns-overview) is a hosting service for DNS domains. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

[Azure Private DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview) is a DNS service for your virtual networks. Azure Private DNS manages and resolves domain names in the virtual network without the need to configure a custom DNS solution.

[Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview) is a service that enables you to query Azure DNS private zones from an on-premises environment and vice versa without deploying VM based DNS servers.

[Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions.
