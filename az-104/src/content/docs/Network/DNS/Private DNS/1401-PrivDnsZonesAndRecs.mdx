### Azure Private DNS Zone Limits
The following default limits apply when using Azure Private DNS:
<PrivateDnsZoneLimits />




Different limits might be enforced by the Azure portal until the portal is updated. Use PowerShell to provision elements up to the most current limits.

### Next steps

* To start using Azure DNS, learn how to [create a DNS zone](./dns-getstarted-portal.md) and [create DNS records](./dns-getstarted-portal.md).
* To migrate an existing DNS zone, learn how to [import and export a DNS zone file](dns-import-export.md).
