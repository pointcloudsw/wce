### Overview
The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating (resolving) a service name to an IP address. Azure DNS provides DNS hosting, resolution, and load balancing for your applications using the Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

DNS functionality is provided by a DNS _name server_, which is a software package that runs on a host computer and is responsible for staring all DNS records for a domain, including A records, MX records, CNAME records, and others.  To ensure its records database is current with other name servers throughout the Domain Name System, the DNS name server exchanges information with other DNS name servers throughout the Domain Name System, so that the system remains as accurate and stable as possible.

In addition to hosting and maintaining current domain name records by sending and receiving updates with other interconnected name servers, the name server is also responsible for responding to queries from clients and other sources that request information pertaining to hostnames, IP addresses, and other DNS-related information.

Almost all domains rely on multiple nameservers to increase reliability: if one nameserver goes down or is unavailable, DNS queries can go to another one. Typically there is one primary nameserver and several secondary nameservers, which store exact copies of the DNS records in the primary server. Updating the primary nameserver will trigger an update of the secondary nameservers as well.

When multiple nameservers are used (as in most cases), NS records should list more than one server. Learn more about DNS servers.

When should NS records be updated or changed?

### [DNS Records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/)
[DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) records (aka **zone files**) are instructions that live in authoritative [DNS servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/) and provide information about a domain including what [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain. These records consist of a series of text files written in what is known as DNS syntax. DNS syntax is just a string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a [‘TTL’](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/), which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how often a DNS server will refresh that record.

You can think of a set of DNS records like a business listing on Yelp. That listing will give you a bunch of useful information about a business such as their location, hours, services offered, etc. All domains are required to have at least a few essential DNS records for a user to be able to access their website using a [domain name](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), and there are several optional records that serve additional purposes.


#### DNS Record names
In Azure DNS, records are specified by using relative names. A *fully qualified* domain name (FQDN) includes the zone name, whereas a *relative* name does not. For example, the relative record name `www` in the zone `contoso.com` gives the fully qualified record name `www.contoso.com`.

An *apex* record is a DNS record at the root (or *apex*) of a DNS zone. For example, in the DNS zone `contoso.com`, an apex record also has the fully qualified name `contoso.com` (this is sometimes called a *naked* domain).  By convention, the relative name '\@' is used to represent apex records.

#### DNS Record types
Each DNS record has a name and a type. Records are organized into various types according to the data they contain. The most common type is an 'A' record, which maps a name to an IPv4 address. Another common type is an 'MX' record, which maps a name to a mail server.

Azure DNS supports all common DNS record types: A, AAAA, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SOA, SRV, and TXT. Note that [SPF records are represented using TXT records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records#spf-records)

:::note
CNAME records are what enables IP address resolution of one or more domain aliases to the IP address of the canonical domain, however CNAME records themselves **DO NOT** hold any IP address information.  Rather, we can think of CNAME records as _pointers_ (alias domain names) to a canonical name and that canonical name then refers to an A/AAAA-record to resolve to an IP address.

### DNS Record sets
Sometimes you need to create more than one DNS record with a given name and type. For example, suppose the 'www.contoso.com' web site is hosted on two different IP addresses. The website requires two different A records, one for each IP address. Here is an example of a record set:

```dns
www.contoso.com.        3600    IN    A    134.170.185.46
www.contoso.com.        3600    IN    A    134.170.188.221
```

Azure DNS manages all DNS records using *record sets*. A record set (also known as a *resource* record set) is the collection of DNS records in a zone that have the same name and are of the same type. Most record sets contain a single record. However, examples like the one above, in which a record set contains more than one record, are not uncommon.

For example, suppose you have already created an A record 'www' in the zone 'contoso.com', pointing to the IP address '134.170.185.46' (the first record above).  To create the second record you would add that record to the existing record set, rather than create an additional record set.

:::note
The SOA and CNAME record types are exceptions. The DNS standards don't permit multiple records with the same name for these types, therefore these record sets can only contain a single record.
