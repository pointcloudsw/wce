### Microsoft Entra ID Groups
Microsoft Entra ID lets you use groups to manage access to **applications**, **data**, and **resources**. Resources can be:
- Part of the Microsoft Entra organization, such as permissions to manage objects through roles in Microsoft Entra ID
- External to the organization, such as for Software as a Service (SaaS) apps
- Azure services
- SharePoint sites
- On-premises resources
    :::danger
    Some groups can't be managed in the Azure portal:
    Groups synced from on-premises Active Directory can be managed only in on-premises Active Directory.
    Distribution lists and mail-enabled security groups are managed only in Exchange admin center or Microsoft 365 admin center. You must sign in to Exchange admin center or Microsoft 365 admin center to manage these groups.
